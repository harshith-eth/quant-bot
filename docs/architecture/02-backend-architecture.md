# Backend Architecture

## Overview

The backend of the Quant-Bot system serves as the core intelligence and operational center of the trading platform. Built with Node.js and TypeScript, the backend implements a modular, service-oriented architecture designed for high performance, reliability, and extensibility. This document details the structure, components, and interactions within the backend system.

## Core Components

### 1. Server Infrastructure

The backend is built around an Express.js server that provides:

- **REST API Endpoints**: For frontend communication and external integrations
- **WebSocket Servers**: For real-time data streaming and event notifications
- **Authentication Middleware**: Ensuring secure access to the system
- **Rate Limiting**: Protecting against API abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and logging

- **Opportunity Scoring**: Ranks tokens based on trading potential

### 5. Trading Engine

The core trading intelligence of the system:

- **Strategy Implementation**: Multiple trading strategies for different scenarios
- **Signal Processor**: Evaluates and acts on signals from various system components
- **Position Manager**: Determines optimal position sizes and entry/exit timing
- **Order Book Analysis**: Real-time analysis of order books for trade execution
- **Portfolio Balancer**: Maintains optimal portfolio allocation based on risk parameters

### 6. Transaction Execution

Handles the execution of trades and other on-chain operations:

- **Jupiter Integration**: Primary swap execution through Jupiter aggregator
- **Multi-Route Execution**: Fallback routes for transaction execution
- **Transaction Builder**: Construction of optimized Solana transactions
- **Gas Optimization**: Dynamic fee settings based on network conditions
- **Failure Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and failure handling

### 7. Risk Management System

Comprehensive risk assessment and protection features:

- **Token Security Analyzer**: Identifies potential security risks in token contracts
- **Value at Risk (VaR) Calculator**: Assesses potential portfolio risk
- **Rug Detection**: Algorithms to identify potential rug pulls
- **Liquidity Analysis**: Assessment of token liquidity for exit planning
- **Portfolio Exposure Limits**: Enforces maximum exposure to individual tokens and categories

### 8. Filters Subsystem

A modular filtering system for token evaluation:

- **Burn Filter**: Identifies tokens with burn mechanisms
- **Mutable Filter**: Detects contracts with mutable code
- **Pool Filter**: Analyzes liquidity pool characteristics
- **Pool-Size Filter**: Evaluates adequacy of liquidity pool size
- **Renounced Contract Detection**: Identifies tokens with renounced ownership

### 9. Cache and Data Storage

Efficient data management across the system:

- **In-Memory Cache**: High-speed caching for frequently accessed data
- **Persistent Storage**: Long-term storage of historical data and configuration
- **Time-Series Data**: Specialized storage for time-series market data
- **State Management**: Maintains system state across restarts and failures

### 10. Service Layer

Business logic and shared services:

- **Portfolio Service**: Manages portfolio state and operations
- **User Service**: Handles user configurations and preferences
- **Notification Service**: Manages alerts and notifications
- **Configuration Service**: Centralizes system configuration management
- **Metrics Service**: Collects and exposes system performance metrics

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Continuous stream of blockchain and market data into the system
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is processed, filtered, and analyzed
3. **Signal Generation**: Processed data generates trading signals
4. **Decision Making**: Signals are evaluated against strategies and risk parameters
5. **Order Creation**: Trading decisions are converted into executable orders
6. **Transaction Execution**: Orders are executed on the blockchain
7. **Result Processing**: Transaction outcomes are analyzed and recorded
8. **State Update**: System state is updated based on execution results
9. **Reporting**: Results and metrics are exposed to the frontend

## Process Architecture

The backend employs a multi-process architecture:

- **Main Process**: Coordinates overall system operation
- **Data Ingestion Processes**: Dedicated processes for high-volume data collection
- **Analysis Workers**: Parallel workers for computationally intensive analysis
