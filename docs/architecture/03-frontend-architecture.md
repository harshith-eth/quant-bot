## Component Architecture

The UI is composed of modular components organized in a hierarchical structure:

### Page Components

Top-level components corresponding to routes in the application:

- **Dashboard**: Main trading dashboard with overview metrics
- **WhaleTracking**: In-depth whale transaction analytics
- **TokenScanner**: Meme token discovery and analysis
- **Portfolio**: Current holdings and performance
- **Trades**: Historical trade records and analytics
- **Settings**: User preferences and system configuration

### Layout Components

Components that define the overall structure of pages:

- **MainLayout**: Common layout with navigation and global UI elements
- **DashboardLayout**: Specialized layout for data-heavy dashboard views
- **AuthLayout**: Layout for authentication-related pages
- **SettingsLayout**: Specialized layout for configuration pages

### Feature Components

Components implementing specific functionality:

- **WhaleActivity**: Real-time display of whale transactions
- **MemeScanner**: Interface for the meme token scanner
- **RiskManagement**: Risk metrics and controls
- **TradingControls**: Manual trading interface
- **AIAnalysis**: AI-powered market analysis
- **MarketOverview**: Market statistics and trends
- **ExecuteTrades**: Transaction execution interface
- **PortfolioStatus**: Portfolio valuation and performance

### UI Components

Reusable interface elements:

- **Button**: Customizable button component
- **Card**: Container with consistent styling
- **Input**: Form inputs with validation
- **Modal**: Overlay dialogs for user interactions
- **Tooltip**: Informational pop-ups
- **Toast**: Notification system
- **Dropdown**: Selection menus
- **Tabs**: Content organization
- **Table**: Data presentation
- **Badge**: Status indicators

### Chart Components

Specialized visualization components:

- **TimeSeriesChart**: Price and volume history
- **CandlestickChart**: Trading patterns visualization
- **HeatMap**: Intensity-based data visualization
- **NetworkGraph**: Relationship visualization (e.g., whale connections)
- **LiquidityChart**: DEX liquidity visualization
- **PieChart**: Portfolio composition
- **MetricsGauge**: Performance indicators

## State Management

The frontend employs a multi-layered state management approach:

### Global State

Managed through React Context providers:

- **AuthContext**: User authentication state
- **ThemeContext**: UI theme preferences
- **NotificationContext**: System-wide notifications
- **SettingsContext**: User configuration
- **LayoutContext**: UI layout preferences

### Server State

Managed through SWR and React Query:

- **Market Data**: Price, volume, and liquidity information
- **Whale Activity**: Recent whale transactions
- **Portfolio Data**: Current holdings and performance
- **Trade History**: Record of executed trades
- **Token List**: Available tokens for trading
- **System Status**: Backend service health and metrics

### Local State

Component-specific state using useState and useReducer:

- **UI State**: Component visibility, expansion status, active tabs
- **Form State**: Input values, validation status, submission state
- **Filter State**: User-selected filters and sorting preferences
- **View Preferences**: User's current view configuration

## Data Flow

### WebSocket Data Stream

Real-time data flows through WebSocket connections:

1. WebSocket connection established on application initialization
2. Data receivers registered for specific data types
3. Incoming messages dispatched to appropriate state managers
4. Components subscribe to state updates
5. UI re-renders with new data

### API-Based Data

Data fetched through REST API calls:

1. Components request data through SWR/React Query hooks
2. Data is fetched from backend API endpoints
3. Responses are cached according to configurable strategies
4. Components render with cached data while revalidation occurs
5. UI updates when fresh data arrives

## UI/UX Design Principles
